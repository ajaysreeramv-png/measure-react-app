# Converter React App

This is a minimal Vite + React scaffold for a measurement converter.

Run locally:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ajays\OneDrive\Desktop\measure\converter-react"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

You can build with `npm run build` and preview with `npm run preview`.
